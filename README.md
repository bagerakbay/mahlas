As artists who start this experiment, we believe that decentralization and autonomy can not be achieved on a static body therefore we embrace temporality and evolvability.

While exploring the boundaries of non-anthropocentric existence we value artists and hybrids.

## Vision
Mahlas is an attempt to strengthen artists, art creation processes and the art scene. It is architected to support, collaboration without borders, decentralization, autonomy and diversity. Core values and principles are transparency, producing copyleft, allocentric, forkable, non-anthropocentric and temporal works.

## Mission
* To create a platform for artistic expression.
* To offer opportunities for employment and collaboration.
* To organize and facilitate exhibitions.
* To encourage new ways of art creation.
* To support collaboration without borders.

*Mahlas does not and will not have a legal basis however it can be presented by various temporary bodies while performing.*
